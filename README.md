# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This repository contains 2 analysis files:
- run_analysis.R: This R script will process the files from the data and produce a single dataset.
- tidy.txt: This is the single dataset file product by the R script.

The R script will perform operations as follows:
1. Download the information in zip format and unzip the file. (If it hasn't already been downloaded)
2. Load the information into tables including labels for representing the data.
3. Merge the data into a single dataset that we can work with.
4. Remove any unwanted data from the dataset.
5. Cleanup the labels.
6. Summarize the data.
7. Write the information to a file for review.

This repository also contains 2 additional files:
- README.md: This file contains a summary of the project.
- CodeBook.md: This file contains additional information regarding the data presented in the data set.
